## To Avoid the Conflict (While Syncing your fork repo) 
For more information [take reference of this article](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).


➡ An easy way to avoid conflicts is to add an 'upstream' for your git repo, as other PR's may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.   
```terminal
git remote add upstream https://github.com/s-bhalode/Hacktoberfest_starter_2k23.git
```
➡ You can verify that the new remote has been added by typing
```terminal
git remote -v
```
➡ To pull any new changes from your parent repo simply run
```terminal
git merge upstream/master
```
